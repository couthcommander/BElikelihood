Description: This package implement the likelihood method for evaluating bioequivalence in the pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC and Cmax). The functions in this package accept 
    bioequivalece data (AUC and Cmax) from a full replicate 2x4 (RTRT/TRTR), 2x3 partial replicate (TRT/RTR), or a 2x2 (RT/TR) design (where R and T for reference and test drugs, 
    respectively). They will calculate the profile likelihoods for the mean difference, total standard deviation ratio, and within subject standard deviation ratio. Plots of standardized profile 
    likelihood (as shown in Figures 2 and 3 in the reference) can be generated and provide evidence for average bioequicalence (ABE),  population bioequivalence (PBE) 
    and individual bioequivalence (IBE) in a unified framework.
